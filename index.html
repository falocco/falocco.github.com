        <p>The word “cascade” in the classifier name means that the resultant
        classifier consists of several simpler classifiers ( stages ) that are
        applied subsequently to a region of interest until at some stage the
        candidate is rejected or all the stages are passed. The word “boosted”
        means that the classifiers at every stage of the cascade are complex
        themselves and they are built out of basic classifiers using one of four
        different boosting techniques (weighted voting). Currently Discrete
        Adaboost, Real Adaboost, Gentle Adaboost and Logitboost are
        supported.</p>
        <p>The basic classifiers are decision-tree classifiers with at least 2
        leaves. Haar-like features are the input to the basic classifers, and
        are calculated as described below.</p>

        <p>There is a lot of frameworks and different api, and all of them
        require lot of learning and code writing to describe what you really
        want to do. Despite of incredible flexibility, this approach is very
        annoying. Most of use cases reduce to several standard variations, for
        which there is no examples at all. Let's look at electronic engineering
        - it have simple parts, like transistors, ICs, microcontrollers, and
        circuit was done by hands. But look for state of art in this field - it
        is model oriented design. Engineer describe process to perform in
        diagrams and software generate code to run on microprocessor. With this
        approach it is easy to make changes, maintain and test things. Why not
        use this in general programming?</p>
